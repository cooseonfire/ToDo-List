# ToDo List

Trello-like web site for mananging your projects.

Create your ToDo List and add new tasks to the dashboard.  
You can specify for the task its:

- priority
- description
- deadline

Add, edit tasks and mark them as done. See your last week's progress and get prediction on how many tasks you can still do (Logistic regression model was used).
